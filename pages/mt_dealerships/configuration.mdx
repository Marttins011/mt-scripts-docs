## Main
This is the main config file of the script where you can choose your framework and dependicies
```lua filename="mt_dealerships/configs/config.lua"
Config = Config or {}

Config.debug = false -- if true it'll print some debug on F8/console and active all zones debug
Config.framework = 'qbx' -- qb, qbx, esx (need to change the export on the Config.core)
Config.core = exports['qb-core']:GetCoreObject() -- Your core export (for qb is exports['qb-core']:GetCoreObject()) (for esx is exports.es_extended:getSharedObject()) (for qbx you can just delete this line and add '@qbx_core/modules/playerdata.lua', to the fxmanifest.lua client_scripts)
Config.target = 'ox_target' -- ox_target, qb-target, interact, ...
Config.banking = 'Renewed-Banking' -- qb-banking, Renewed-Banking, (can change at server/functions.lua) ...

Config.webhooks = {
    vehicleImported = '',
    vehicleBought = '',
}

Config.commands = {
    addStock = { command = 'addstock', restricted = 'group.admin' },
    removeStock = { command = 'removestock', restricted = 'group.admin' },
}
```

## Vehicles
This is where you can add your vehicles to show on the dealership, you can choose the shop, category and etc to place on the vehicle
```lua filename="mt_dealerships/configs/vehicles.lua"
Config.vehicles = Config.vehicles or {}

local vehicles = { -- Vehicle list, credits to qb-core!
    {
        model = 'asbo',        -- This has to match the spawn code of the vehicle
        name = 'Asbo',         -- This is the display of the vehicle
        brand = 'Maxwell',     -- This is the vehicle's brand
        price = 4000,          -- The price that the vehicle sells for
        category = 'compacts', -- Category of the vehilce, stick with GetVehicleClass() options https://docs.fivem.net/natives/?_0x29439776AAA00A62
        shop = { 'cardealer', 'fmpdm' }, -- Can be a single shop or multiple shops. For multiple shops for example {'shopname1','shopname2','shopname3'}
        class = 'C', --  This is the vehicle class, can be D, C, B, A, S or X (optional)
        seats = 2, -- Number of seats (optional)
        weight = 50, -- Vehicle trunk weight or total weight includin glove box (optional)
    }
}

for i = 1, #vehicles do
    Config.vehicles[vehicles[i].model] = {
        spawncode = vehicles[i].model,
        name = vehicles[i].name,
        brand = vehicles[i].brand,
        model = vehicles[i].model,
        price = vehicles[i].price,
        category = vehicles[i].category,
        shop = vehicles[i].shop,
        class = vehicles[i].class or nil,
        seats = vehicles[i].seats or nil,
        weight = vehicles[i].weight or nil,
    }
end
```

## Dealerships folder
This is an example of dealership config, follow the example and read the comments to understand what does every field and how to create your own restaurant

## Add new vehicles images
To add new images to vehicles make sure that you have the vehiclesImages folder inside of mt_dealerships folder like this:
![imagem](https://i.ibb.co/W30Vnc1/Captura-de-ecr-2024-06-02-154736.png)

If the folder is not created make sure to create it, the name needs to be `vehiclesImages`

After creating the folder you just need to add some vehicle image inside of it and make sure that the image name is the spawn name of the vehicle followed with .png for example `adder.png`

Here's an example:
